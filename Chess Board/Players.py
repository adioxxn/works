# These classes help make it easier to interact with human and computer players
# by using a common interface.  
#     PlayerInterface
#     - a base class that remembers the game
#     HumanMenu
#     - uses the game to create a numbered list of moves
#     - asks the user to choose one of the moves
#     - interaction through the console
#     ComputerInterface
#     - needs a search class object (e.g., Minimax, AlphaBeta, etc)
#     VerboseComputer
#     - subclass of ComputerInterface to obtain moves from a search algorithm
#     - adds a bit of console IO for human v computer, or other debugging purposes
#     SilentComputer
#     - subclass of ComputerInterface to obtain moves from a search algorithm
#     - no console IO at all
#     - good for Computer vs Computer where you just care about the outcome

# The interface features the method
#   ask_move(state)
#   - returns an action legal in the given state
#     (the action must be an action as defined in game.actions())
#
# Here's an example of how to use these classes:
#   # setup
#   game = <create a game object from a Game Class>
#   searcher = Minimax(game)         # create a search class instance
#   player1 = Players.VerboseComputer(game, Searcher.Minimax(game))
#   player2 = Players.HumanMenu(game)
#
#   # player1's turn!
#   state = game.initial_state()
#   choice1 = player1.ask_move(state)
#   assert choice1 in game.actions(state), "The action <{}> is not legal in this state".format(choice)
# 
#   # player2's turn!
#     choice2 = player2.ask_move(state)
#     assert choice2 in game.actions(state), "The action <{}> is not legal in this state".format(choice)
